# Phetphlix Movie Recommender
 
This repository contains a movie recommender API, which recommends a list of movies based on a given history of movies that the user has watched. The past movies viewed by the user are assessed based on distinct criteria such as the movie's genre, actors, and director. The set of criteria is then used to filter and score all movies in the database that the user can watch. Using a scoring system, the recommender app then outputs the most compatible movies for the user. This API, which implements a predetermined database of users and movies, is built on an algorithm centered on Binary Search Trees (BSTs) to enable efficient storage of data and searching.
