# Phetphlix Movie Recommender
 
This repository contains a movie recommender API that suggests a list of movies based on the user's viewing history. The user's past movies are analyzed according to various criteria, such as genre, actors, and director. These criteria are then used to filter and score all movies in the database that are available to the user. Using this scoring system, the API outputs the most compatible movie recommendations. The API, which utilizes a predefined database of users and movies, is built on an algorithm centered around Binary Search Trees (BSTs) to enable efficient data storage and searching.
